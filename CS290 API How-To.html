	<div id="introBox"><br><h2>...So what is an API? </h2><br>
		<p>At its most basic, an API (or Application Programming Interface) is a set of tools
			and data, often provided by a third party, which enables the programmer 
			to add useful functionality when developing a program.  APIs work for programmers in a
			similar conceptual way as GUIs (or Graphical User Interfaces) work for users, by 
			providing a level of abstraction that limits the need for in-depth knowledge of its 
			'inner-workings' or underlying code. (1) 
		</p>
		
		<p>APIs can be used to access data from a provider's data base (such as Wikipedia or NASA), 
		incorporate map and navigation functionality into a program (such as Google Maps) or publish
		content to social media (Facebook).  The benefits of using an API may include less coding 
		required for the same functionality on the developer's part, with more code testing provided 
		by the third part than the developer may otherwise be able to perform, thereby providing a 
		significant increase in productivity.  (2) 
		</p>

		<h2>The Yelp Fusion API</h2>
		<p>The Yelp Fusion API allows developers to add functionality for finding and reviewing businesses.  
		The API is broken into two individual APIs- one for searching available businesses in Yelp (using GPS
		functionality), and another for examining details for a given business (ex: hours of operation, reviews, and 
		photos).</p>

		<p>The API functions by using standard, secure authorization protocols 
			<a class="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a> and  
			<a class="links" href="https://www.x.org/archive/X11R6.8.1/doc/xauth.1.html">xAuth</a>
		to authenticate requests.  OAuth is used for Yelp login; xAuth provides a way 
		for username/password exchange [to obtain an OAuth access token].  There are currently 2 versions of the 
		Yelp Fusion API being used- versions 2 and 3.  <a href="https://github.com/Yelp/yelp-fusion">Version 3 has been 
		recently introduced</a> to supplement existing v2 functionality.  Changes between the two versions include an upgraded version of OAuth; Yelp v2 uses OAuth 
		v1a, and Yelp v3 uses OAuth v2.  Yelp v3 also includes autocomplete functionality and a search endpoint for 
		food delivery from businesses.</p>
		<p>In this review, we will focus on Yelp v2 as it has been around much longer, has been more extensively 
		utilized (and therefore tested), and has a greater amount of associated documentation than Yelp v3.
		</p>

		<p>To access the API, it's necessary to go through the following series of steps, as described in detail
		at the links above: 
			</p><ol>
				<li>Install the necessary Node.js packages using npm 
				</li><li>Get authentication credentials: Request an API Key, Secret, and Token from Yelp by creating an "App". 
				There are 2 versions of the API, v2 and v3, which vary slightly in how credentials are obtained.
				</li><li>Make an API Request: Use Key, Secret, Token and Token Secret to authenticate API calls when requesting 
				information from Yelp
				</li><li>API Response: Parse and process the returned data
			</li></ol>

	<div id="introBox2"><h2>What is Node.js and npm?</h2>
		<p>Node.js is a JavaScript-based platform used to develop web applications outside of the 
			browser (1).  It allows for <strong>Asynchronous Input/Output (I/O)</strong>, whereby program/
			script processing can run concurrently with input and output operations.  Traditionally, 
			I/O has been <strong>Synchronous</strong>:  I/O would halt executing script or program processes, 
			pending its completion.  Because I/O can be a very slow process (possibly seeking
			or writing data to a mechanical system), Synchronous I/O can significantly impact program performance.
			(2)</p>

			<p>npm, or <strong>NodeJS Package Manager</strong> is included when installing Node.js.  It is used 
			on the command line and works with a remote registry to install a variety (over 280,000!) of "packages" 
			or shared Javascript code modules provided by a third party(3).
